We have developed a mobile and web app that optimizes waste management processes and provides real-time waste analytics.
We provide Smart bin, monitor them , do recycling guides, and community cleanup events.
With this platform, a bin gives real time analytics on the levels of fill and give a notification when full.
Should a bin fail to give notification, the customer can notify us by filling a form and submit hence a notification is delivered to us.
We also partner with recycling industries to whom we dispose the waste.
This system targets the municipalities, business organisation, recycling industries and eco-conscious customer to the environment.
